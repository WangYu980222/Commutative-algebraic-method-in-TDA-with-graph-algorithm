# Commutative-algebraic-method-in-TDA-with-graph-algorithm
This program consists of an algorithm to use commutative algebraic methods in Topological Data Analysis with graph theorem (and without computational commutative algebra).  The algorithm will be applied for Vietoris-Rips complex and use the commutative algebraic method according to Stanley-Reisner ideals.
